# Cell Segmentation and Tracking Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project harnesses the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the specialized U-net architecture for biomedical image analysis. By leveraging large datasets of labeled cell images, U-net accurately segments individual cells from complex backgrounds, overcoming challenges such as overlapping cells and varying intensities. Integration of tracking algorithms enables the monitoring of cell behavior over time, facilitating the analysis of dynamic processes like cell migration and proliferation. This framework accelerates discoveries in cellular biology and offers insights for medical research and clinical applications.
